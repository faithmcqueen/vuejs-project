			<!-- EXPLANATION OF NEXT DIV
				
				Need to render our array (squares) onto our page. We can do this by calling the array using v-for. We need to pass through the item we are rendering, and the index of the array. This will create 9 squares, as our array has 9 values that we are looping through.
				Source for v-for: https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/list.html

				Next we need to set up a listener for the onclick action of a square. v-on will listen, for the click, and on that click will call our makeMove function. We call that function through our currentGame, which works with the constructor() function. When we call makeMove, we also need to pass through which index we are in, as that function expects a parameter. 
				Source for v-on: https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/events.html

				
				Next, we need to add our "displayWin" class if the game has been won. We need to bind displayWin to our winningSquare variable, held in our Square() class. This will only show if winningSquare is true.
